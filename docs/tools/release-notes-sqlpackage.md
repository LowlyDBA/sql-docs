# Release notes for SqlPackage.exe

**[Download the latest version](sqlpackage-download.md)**

This article lists the features and fixes delivered by the released versions of SqlPackage.exe.

<!--
TODO:
The Introduction text needs to add clarity regarding the relationship between
'SqlPackage.exe' and 'DacFx' (the Microsoft 'Data-Tier Application Framework').
One added sentence would be sufficient.

Or, if there is no relationship, remove 'DacFx' from the metadata 'title:'.

I discussed this with SStein (SteveStein).
Thanks.  GeneMi (MightyPen in GitHub).  2019-03-27
