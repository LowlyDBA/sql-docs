## Python quickstarts and tutorials

| Link | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Quickstart: "Hello world" Python script in SQL Server](quickstart-python-run-using-t-sql.md) | Learn the basics of how to call Python in T-SQL. |
| [Quickstart: Create, train, and use a Python model with stored procedures in SQL Server](quickstart-python-train-score-in-tsql.md) | Explains the mechanics of embedding Python code in a stored procedure, providing inputs, and stored procedure execution. |
| [Tutorial: Create a model using revoscalepy](use-python-revoscalepy-to-create-model.md) | Demonstrates how to run code from a remote Python terminal, using SQL Server compute context. You should be somewhat familiar with Python tools and environments. Sample code is provided that creates a model using **rxLinMod**, from the new **revoscalepy** library. |
| [Tutorial: Learn in-Database Python analytics for SQL developers](sqldev-in-database-python-for-sql-developers.md) | This end-to-end walkthrough demonstrates the process of building a complete Python solution using T-SQL stored procedures. All Python code is included.|
