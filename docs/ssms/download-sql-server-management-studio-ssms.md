# Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL Server and databases. Use SSMS to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications, as well as build queries and scripts.

Use SSMS to query, design, and manage your databases and data warehouses, wherever they are - on your local computer, or in the cloud.

SSMS is free!

## SSMS installation tips and issues (SSMS 17.9.1)

### Minimize Installation Reboots

* Take the following actions to reduce the chances of SSMS setup requiring a reboot at the end of installation:
  * Make sure you are running an up-to-date version of the Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package. Version 12.0.40649.5 (or greater) is required. Only the x64 version is needed.
  * Verify the version of .NET Framework on the computer is 4.6.1 (or greater).
  * Close every instance of Visual Studio that are open on the computer.
  * Make sure all the latest OS updates are installed on the computer.
  * The noted actions are typically required only once. There are few cases where a reboot is required during additional upgrades to the same major version of SSMS. For minor upgrades, all the prerequisites for SSMS are already installed on the computer.

## SSMS 18.0 (RC1)

**SSMS 18.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1) is now available, and is the latest generation of *SQL Server Management Studio* that provides support for [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]!**

**[![download](../ssdt/media/download.png) Download SQL Server Management Studio 18.0 (RC1)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085742)**

The SSMS 18.x installation does not upgrade or replace SSMS versions 17.x or earlier. SSMS 18.x installs side by side with previous versions so both versions are available for use.

If a computer contains side by side installations of SSMS, verify you start the correct version for your specific needs. The latest version is labeled **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18**:

## New in this Release (SSMS 18.0 RC1)

SSMS 18.0 (RC1) is the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio. The 18.x generation of SSMS provides support for almost all feature areas on SQL Server 2008 through SQL Server 2019 preview.

For details about what's new in this release, see [the SSMS release notes](release-notes-ssms.md).

## Supported SQL offerings (SSMS 18.0 RC1)

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* Additionally, SSMS 18.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 17.x, SSMS 16.x, or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier.
* SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) - SSMS version 17.x or later does not support connecting to the legacy SQL Server Integration Services service. To connect to an earlier version of the legacy Integration Services, use the version of SSMS aligned with the version of SQL Server. For example, use SSMS 16.x to connect to the legacy SQL Server 2016 Integration Services service. SSMS 17.x and SSMS 16.x can be installed side-by-side on the same computer. Since the release of SQL Server 2012, the SSIS Catalog database, SSISDB, is the recommended way to store, manage, run, and monitor Integration Services packages. For details, see [SSIS Catalog](../integration-services/catalog/ssis-catalog.md).
