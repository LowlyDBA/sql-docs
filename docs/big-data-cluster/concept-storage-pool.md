# What is the storage pool (SQL Server big data clusters)?

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]

This article describes the role of the *SQL Server storage pool* in a SQL Server 2019 big data cluster (preview). The following sections describe the architecture and functionality of a SQL storage pool.

## Storage pool architecture

The storage pool consists of storage nodes comprised of SQL Server on Linux, Spark, and HDFS. All the storage nodes in a SQL big data cluster are members of an HDFS cluster.

## Responsibilities

Storage nodes are responsible for:

- Data ingestion through Spark.
- Data storage in HDFS (Parquet format). HDFS also provides data persistency, as HDFS data is spread across all the storage nodes in the SQL big data cluster.
- Data access through HDFS and SQL Server endpoints.

## Next steps
