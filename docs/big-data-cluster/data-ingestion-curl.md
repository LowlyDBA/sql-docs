# Use curl to load data into HDFS on SQL Server big data clusters

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]

This article explains how to use **curl** to load data into HDFS on SQL Server 2019 big data clusters (preview).

## Obtain the service external IP

WebHDFS is started when deployment is completed, and its access goes through Knox. The Knox endpoint is exposed through a Kubernetes service called **endpoint-security**.  To create the necessary WebHDFS URL to upload/download files, you need the **endpoint-security** service external IP address and the name of your cluster. You can get the **endpoint-security** service external IP address by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get service endpoint-security -n <cluster name> -o json | jq -r .status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `<cluster name>` here is the name of the cluster that you provided when you ran `mssqlctl cluster create --name <cluster name>`.

## Construct the URL to access WebHDFS

Now, you can construct the URL to access the WebHDFS as follows:

`https://<endpoint-security service external IP address>:30443/gateway/default/webhdfs/v1/`

For example:

`https://13.66.190.205:30443/gateway/default/webhdfs/v1/`

## List a file

To list file under **hdfs:///airlinedata**, use the following curl command:

```bash
curl -i -k -u root:root-password -X GET 'https://<endpoint-security IP external address>:30443/gateway/default/webhdfs/v1/airlinedata/?op=liststatus'
```

## Put a local file into HDFS

To put a new file **test.csv** from local directory to airlinedata directory, use the following curl command (the **Content-Type** parameter is required):

```bash
curl -i -L -k -u root:root-password -X PUT 'https://<endpoint-security IP external address>:30443/gateway/default/webhdfs/v1/airlinedata/test.csv?op=create' -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' -T 'test.csv'
```

## Create a directory

To create a directory **test** under `hdfs:///`, use the following command:

```bash
curl -i -L -k -u root:root-password -X PUT 'https://<endpoint-security IP external address>:30443/gateway/default/webhdfs/v1/test?op=MKDIRS'
```
