# Release notes for big data clusters on SQL Server

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]

This article lists the updates and know issues for the most recent releases of SQL Server big data clusters.

[!INCLUDE [Limited public preview note](../includes/big-data-cluster-preview-note.md)]

## <a id="ctp24"></a> CTP 2.4 (March)

The following sections describe the new features and known issues for big data clusters in SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.4.

### What's New

| New feature or update | Details |
|:---|:---|
| Guidance on GPU support for running deep learning with TensorFlow in Spark. | [Deploy a big data cluster with GPU support and run TensorFlow](spark-gpu-tensorflow.md). |
| **SqlDataPool** and **SqlStoragePool** data sources are no longer created by default. | Create these manually as needed. See the [known issues](#externaltablesctp24). |
| `INSERT INTO SELECT` support for the data pool. | For an example, see [Tutorial: Ingest data into a SQL Server data pool with Transact-SQL](tutorial-data-pool-ingest-sql.md). |
| `FORCE SCALEOUTEXECUTION` and `DISABLE SCALEOUTEXECUTION` option. | Forces or disables the use of the compute pool for queries on external tables. For example, `SELECT TOP(100) * FROM web_clickstreams_hdfs_book_clicks OPTION(FORCE SCALEOUTEXECUTION)`. |
| Updated AKS deployment recommendations. | When evaluating big data clusters on AKS, we now recommend using a single node of size **Standard_L8s**. |
| Spark runtime upgrade to Spark 2.4. | |

### Known issues

The following sections describe the known issues and limitations with this release.

#### Deployment

- Upgrading a big data data cluster from a previous release is not supported.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must backup your data and then delete your existing big data cluster (using the previous version of **mssqlctl**) before deploying the latest release. For more information, see [Upgrade to a new release](deployment-guidance.md#upgrade).

- After deploying on AKS, you might see the following two warning events from the deployment. Both of these events are known issues, but they do not prevent you from successfully deploying the big data cluster on AKS.

   `Warning  FailedMount: Unable to mount volumes for pod "mssql-storage-pool-default-1_sqlarisaksclus(c83eae70-c81b-11e8-930f-f6b6baeb7348)": timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach or mount for pod "sqlarisaksclus"/"mssql-storage-pool-default-1". list of unmounted volumes=[storage-pool-storage hdfs storage-pool-mlservices-storage hadoop-logs]. list of unattached volumes=[storage-pool-storage hdfs storage-pool-mlservices-storage hadoop-logs storage-pool-java-storage secrets default-token-q9mlx]`

   `Warning  Unhealthy: Readiness probe failed: cat: /tmp/provisioner.done: No such file or directory`

- If a big data cluster deployment fails, the associated namespace is not removed. This could result in an orphaned namespace on the cluster. A workaround is to delete the namespace manually before deploying a cluster with the same name.

#### kubeadm deployments

If you use kubeadm to deploy Kubernetes on multiple machines, the cluster administration portal does not correctly display the endpoints needed to connect to the big data cluster. If you are experiencing this problem, use the following work around to discover the service endpoint IP addresses:

- If you are connecting from within the cluster, query Kubernetes for the service IP for the endpoint that you want to connect to. For example, the following **kubectl** command displays the IP address of the SQL Server master instance:

   ```bash
   kubectl get service endpoint-master-pool -n <clusterName> -o=custom-columns="IP:.spec.clusterIP,PORT:.spec.ports[*].nodePort"
   ```

- If you are connecting from outside the cluster, use the following steps to connect:

   1. Get the IP address of the node running the SQL Server master instance: `kubectl get pod mssql-master-pool-0 -o jsonpath="Name: {.metadata.name} Status: {.status.hostIP}" -n <clusterName>`.

   1. Connect to SQL Server master instance using this IP address.

   1. Query the **cluster_endpoint_table** in master database for other external endpoints.

      If this fails with a connection timeout, it is possible the respective node is firewalled. In this case, you must contact your Kubernetes cluster administrator and ask for the node IP that is exposed externally. This could be any node. You can then use that IP and the corresponding port to connect to various services running in the cluster. For example, the administrator can find this IP by running:

      ```
      [root@m12hn01 config]# kubectl cluster-info
      Kubernetes master is running at https://172.50.253.99:6443
      KubeDNS is running at https://172.30.243.91:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
      ```

#### Delete cluster fails

When you attempt to delete a cluster with **mssqlctl**, it fails with the following error:

```
2019-03-26 20:38:11.0614 UTC | INFO | Deleting cluster ...
Error processing command: "TypeError"
delete_namespaced_service() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
Makefile:61: recipe for target 'delete-cluster' failed
make[2]: *** [delete-cluster] Error 1
Makefile:223: recipe for target 'deploy-clean' failed
make[1]: *** [deploy-clean] Error 2
Makefile:203: recipe for target 'deploy-clean' failed
make: *** [deploy-clean] Error 2
```

A new Python Kubernetes client (version 9.0.0) changed the delete namespaces API, which currently breaks **mssqlctl**. This only happens if you have a newer Kubernetes python client installed. You can work around this problem by directly deleting the cluster using **kubectl** (`kubectl delete ns <ClusterName>`), or you can install the older version using `sudo pip install kubernetes==8.0.1`.

#### <a id="externaltablesctp24"></a> External tables

- Big data cluster deployment no longer creates the **SqlDataPool** and **SqlStoragePool** external data sources. You can create these data sources manually to support data virtualization to the data pool and storage pool.

   ```sql
   -- Create the SqlDataPool data source:
   IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'SqlDataPool')
     CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE SqlDataPool
     WITH (LOCATION = 'sqldatapool://service-mssql-controller:8080/datapools/default');

   -- Create the SqlStoragePool data source:
   IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'SqlStoragePool')
   BEGIN
     IF SERVERPROPERTY('ProductLevel') = 'CTP2.3'
       CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE SqlStoragePool
       WITH (LOCATION = 'sqlhdfs://service-mssql-controller:8080');
     ELSE IF SERVERPROPERTY('ProductLevel') = 'CTP2.4'
       CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE SqlStoragePool
       WITH (LOCATION = 'sqlhdfs://service-master-pool:50070');
   END
   ```

- It is possible to create a data pool external table for a table that has unsupported column types. If you query the external table, you get a message similar to the following:

   `Msg 7320, Level 16, State 110, Line 44 Cannot execute the query "Remote Query" against OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI11" for linked server "(null)". 105079; Columns with large object types are not supported for external generic tables.`

- If you query a storage pool external table, you might get an error if the underlying file is being copied into HDFS at the same time.

   `Msg 7320, Level 16, State 110, Line 157 Cannot execute the query "Remote Query" against OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI11" for linked server "(null)". 110806;A distributed query failed: One or more errors occurred.`

- If you are creating an external table to Oracle that use character data types, the Azure Data Studio virtualization wizard interprets these columns as VARCHAR in the external table definition. This will cause a failure in the external table DDL. Either modify the Oracle schema to use the NVARCHAR2 type, or create EXTERNAL TABLE statements manually and specify NVARCHAR instead of using the wizard.

#### Application deployment

- When calling an R, Python, or MLeap application from the RESTful API, the call times-out in 5 minutes.

#### Spark and notebooks

- POD IP addresses may change in the Kubernetes environment as PODs restarts. In the scenario where the master-pod restarts, the Spark session may fail with `NoRoteToHostException`. This is caused by JVM caches that don't get refreshed with new IP addresses.

- If you have Jupyter already installed and a separate Python on Windows, Spark notebooks might fail. To work around this issue, upgrade Jupyter to the latest version.

- In a notebook, if you click the **Add Text** command, the text cell is added in preview mode rather than edit mode. You can click on the preview icon to toggle to edit mode and edit the cell.

#### HDFS

- If you right-click on a file in HDFS to preview it, you might see the following error:

   `Error previewing file: File exceeds max size of 30MB`

   Currently there is no way to preview files larger than 30 MB in Azure Data Studio.

- Configuration changes to HDFS that involve changes to hdfs-site.xml are not supported.

#### Security

- The SA_PASSWORD is part of the environment and discoverable (for example in a cord dump file). You must reset the SA_PASSWORD on the master instance after deployment. This is not a bug but a security step. For more information on how to change the SA_PASSWORD in a Linux container, see [Change the SA password](../linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker.md#sapassword).

- AKS logs may contain SA password for big data cluster deployments.

### Known issues

The following sections describe the known issues and limitations with this release.

#### Deployment

- Upgrading a big data data cluster from a previous release is not supported.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must backup your data and then delete your existing big data cluster (using the previous version of **mssqlctl**) before deploying the latest release. For more information, see [Upgrade to a new release](deployment-guidance.md#upgrade).

- The **ACCEPT_EULA** environment variable must be "yes" or "Yes" to accept the EULA. Previous releases permitted "y" and "Y" but these are no longer accepted and will cause the deployment to fail.

- The **CLUSTER_PLATFORM** environment variables does not have a default as it did in previous releases.

- After deploying on AKS, you might see the following two warning events from the deployment. Both of these events are known issues, but they do not prevent you from successfully deploying the big data cluster on AKS.

   `Warning  FailedMount: Unable to mount volumes for pod "mssql-storage-pool-default-1_sqlarisaksclus(c83eae70-c81b-11e8-930f-f6b6baeb7348)": timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach or mount for pod "sqlarisaksclus"/"mssql-storage-pool-default-1". list of unmounted volumes=[storage-pool-storage hdfs storage-pool-mlservices-storage hadoop-logs]. list of unattached volumes=[storage-pool-storage hdfs storage-pool-mlservices-storage hadoop-logs storage-pool-java-storage secrets default-token-q9mlx]`

   `Warning  Unhealthy: Readiness probe failed: cat: /tmp/provisioner.done: No such file or directory`

- If a big data cluster deployment fails, the associated namespace is not removed. This could result in an orphaned namespace on the cluster. A workaround is to delete the namespace manually before deploying a cluster with the same name.

   ```

- If you are connecting from outside the cluster, use the following steps to connect:

   1. Get the IP address of the node running the SQL Server master instance: `kubectl get pod mssql-master-pool-0 -o jsonpath="Name: {.metadata.name} Status: {.status.hostIP}" -n <clusterName>`.

      KubeDNS is running at https://172.30.243.91:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
      ```

#### <a id="mssqlctlctp23"></a> mssqlctl

- The **mssqlctl** tool changed from a verb-noun command ordering to a noun-verb order. For example, `mssqlctl create cluster` is now `mssqlctl cluster create`.

- The `--name` parameter is now required when creating a cluster with `mssqlctl cluster create`.

   ```bash
   mssqlctl cluster create --name <cluster_name>
   ```

- For important information about upgrading to the latest version of big data clusters and **mssqlctl**, see [Upgrade to a new release](deployment-guidance.md#upgrade).

#### External tables

- It is possible to create a data pool external table for a table that has unsupported column types. If you query the external table, you get a message similar to the following:

   `Msg 7320, Level 16, State 110, Line 44 Cannot execute the query "Remote Query" against OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI11" for linked server "(null)". 105079; Columns with large object types are not supported for external generic tables.`

- If you query a storage pool external table, you might get an error if the underlying file is being copied into HDFS at the same time.

   `Msg 7320, Level 16, State 110, Line 157 Cannot execute the query "Remote Query" against OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI11" for linked server "(null)". 110806;A distributed query failed: One or more errors occurred.`

- If you are creating an external table to Oracle that use character data types, the Azure Data Studio virtualization wizard interprets these columns as VARCHAR in the external table definition. This will cause a failure in the external table DDL. Either modify the Oracle schema to use the NVARCHAR2 type, or create EXTERNAL TABLE statements manually and specify NVARCHAR instead of using the wizard.

#### Application deployment

- When calling an R, Python, or MLeap application from the RESTful API, the call times-out in 5 minutes.

#### Spark and notebooks

- POD IP addresses may change in the Kubernetes environment as PODs restarts. In the scenario where the master-pod restarts, the Spark session may fail with `NoRoteToHostException`. This is caused by JVM caches that don't get refreshed with new IP addresses.

- If you have Jupyter already installed and a separate Python on Windows, Spark notebooks might fail. To work around this issue, upgrade Jupyter to the latest version.

- In a notebook, if you click the **Add Text** command, the text cell is added in preview mode rather than edit mode. You can click on the preview icon to toggle to edit mode and edit the cell.

#### HDFS

- If you right-click on a file in HDFS to preview it, you might see the following error:

   `Error previewing file: File exceeds max size of 30MB`

   Currently there is no way to preview files larger than 30 MB in Azure Data Studio.

- Configuration changes to HDFS that involve changes to hdfs-site.xml are not supported.

#### Security

- The SA_PASSWORD is part of the environment and discoverable (for example in a cord dump file). You must reset the SA_PASSWORD on the master instance after deployment. This is not a bug but a security step. For more information on how to change the SA_PASSWORD in a Linux container, see [Change the SA password](../linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker.md#sapassword).

- AKS logs may contain SA password for big data cluster deployments.

## <a id="ctp22"></a> CTP 2.2 (December 2018)

- If a big data cluster deployment fails, the associated namespace is not removed. This could result in an orphaned namespace on the cluster. A workaround is to delete the namespace manually before deploying a cluster with the same name.

#### Cluster administration portal

The cluster administration portal does not display the endpoint for the SQL Server master instance. To find the IP address and port for the master instance, use the following **kubectl** command:

```
kubectl get svc endpoint-master-pool -n <your-cluster-name>
```

#### External tables

- It is possible to create a data pool external table for a table that has unsupported column types. If you query the external table, you get a message similar to the following:

   `Msg 7320, Level 16, State 110, Line 44 Cannot execute the query "Remote Query" against OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI11" for linked server "(null)". 105079; Columns with large object types are not supported for external generic tables.`

## <a id="ctp21"></a> CTP 2.1 (November 2018)

The following sections describe the new features and known issues for big data clusters in SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.1.

### New features

- [Deploy Python and R apps](big-data-cluster-create-apps.md) in a big data cluster.
- New version of **mssqlctl** and updated images. 
- Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.

### Known issues

The following sections provide known issues for SQL Server big data clusters in CTP 2.1.

#### Deployment

- Upgrading a big data data cluster from a previous release is not supported. You must backup and delete any existing big data cluster before deploying the latest release. For more information, see [Upgrade to a new release](deployment-guidance.md#upgrade).

- After deploying on AKS, you might see the following two warning events from the deployment. Both of these events are known issues, but they do not prevent you from successfully deploying the big data cluster on AKS.

   `Warning  FailedMount: Unable to mount volumes for pod "mssql-storage-pool-default-1_sqlarisaksclus(c83eae70-c81b-11e8-930f-f6b6baeb7348)": timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach or mount for pod "sqlarisaksclus"/"mssql-storage-pool-default-1". list of unmounted volumes=[storage-pool-storage hdfs storage-pool-mlservices-storage hadoop-logs]. list of unattached volumes=[storage-pool-storage hdfs storage-pool-mlservices-storage hadoop-logs storage-pool-java-storage secrets default-token-q9mlx]`

### Known issues

The following sections provide known issues for SQL Server big data clusters in CTP 2.0.

#### Deployment

- If you are using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the recommended version of Kubernetes is 1.10.*, which does not support disk resizing. You should make sure you are sizing the storage accordingly at deployment time. For more information on how to adjust storage sizes, see the [Data persistence](concept-data-persistence.md) article. For Kubernetes deployed on VMs, the recommended version is 1.11.

- After deploying on AKS, you might see the following two warning events from the deployment. Both of these events are known issues, but they do not prevent you from successfully deploying the big data cluster on AKS.

   `Warning  FailedMount: Unable to mount volumes for pod "mssql-storage-pool-default-1_sqlarisaksclus(c83eae70-c81b-11e8-930f-f6b6baeb7348)": timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach or mount for pod "sqlarisaksclus"/"mssql-storage-pool-default-1". list of unmounted volumes=[storage-pool-storage hdfs storage-pool-mlservices-storage hadoop-logs]. list of unattached volumes=[storage-pool-storage hdfs storage-pool-mlservices-storage hadoop-logs storage-pool-java-storage secrets default-token-q9mlx]`

   `Warning  Unhealthy: Readiness probe failed: cat: /tmp/provisioner.done: No such file or directory`

- If a big data cluster deployment fails, the associated namespace is not removed. This could result in an orphaned namespace on the cluster. A workaround is to delete the namespace manually before deploying a cluster with the same name.

#### External tables

- It is possible to create a data pool external table for a table that has unsupported column types. If you query the external table, you get a message similar to the following:

   `Msg 7320, Level 16, State 110, Line 44 Cannot execute the query "Remote Query" against OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI11" for linked server "(null)". 105079; Columns with large object types are not supported for external generic tables.`

- If you query a storage pool external table, you might get an error if the underlying file is being copied into HDFS at the same time.

   `Msg 7320, Level 16, State 110, Line 157 Cannot execute the query "Remote Query" against OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI11" for linked server "(null)". 110806;A distributed query failed: One or more errors occurred.`

#### Spark and notebooks

- POD IP addresses may change in the Kubernetes environment as PODs restarts. In the scenario where the master-pod restarts, the Spark session may fail with `NoRoteToHostException`. This is caused by JVM caches that don't get refreshed with new IP addresses.

- If you have Jupyter already installed and a separate Python on Windows, Spark notebooks might fail. To work around this issue, upgrade Jupyter to the latest version.

- In a notebook, if you click the **Add Text** command, the text cell is added in preview mode rather than edit mode. You can click on the preview icon to toggle to edit mode and edit the cell.

#### HDFS

- If you right-click on a file in HDFS to preview it, you might see the following error:

   `Error previewing file: File exceeds max size of 30MB`

   Currently there is no way to preview files larger than 30 MB in Azure Data Studio.

- Configuration changes to HDFS that involve changes to hdfs-site.xml are not supported.

#### Security

- The SA_PASSWORD is part of the environment and discoverable (for example in a cord dump file). You must reset the SA_PASSWORD on the master instance after deployment. This is not a bug but a security step. For more information on how to change the SA_PASSWORD in a Linux container, see [Change the SA password](../linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker.md#sapassword).

- AKS logs may contain SA password for big data cluster deployments.
