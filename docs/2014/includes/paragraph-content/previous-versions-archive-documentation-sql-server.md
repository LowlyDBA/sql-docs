We accumulate and retain documentation for very old versions of SQL Server in a set of archive webpages. You can see these archives at [SQL Server previous versions documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/).

As of November 2018, these archives include the documentation for at least the following:
- SQL Server 2012

- SQL Server 2008
- SQL Server 2005
